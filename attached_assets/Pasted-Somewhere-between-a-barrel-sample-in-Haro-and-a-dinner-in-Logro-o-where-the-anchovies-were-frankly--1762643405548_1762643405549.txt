Somewhere between a barrel sample in Haro and a dinner in Logroño where the anchovies were, frankly, too good to be polite about, I fell hard for Rioja. So this letter is, in a sense, a love note. Or maybe a thank-you. Or maybe just what it is: my wholehearted application to join Rioja Camp 2025.
I come to wine the way many of us do, not by straight path but by appetite. I'm a winemaker, educator, and storyteller who believes a good glass of wine should tell you something true: about the land, yes, but also about the people who tend it, and the hands that lift the bottle to the table.
Through my project, Barrel & Verse, I’ve had the joy of capturing wine stories and creating educational experiences and tastings that connect people more deeply to what’s in their glass. The project has taken me from vineyard sourcing and winemaking to leading workshops that explore not just how wine is made, but why it matters, pairing technical insight with narrative, culture, music, and memory. 
In addition to completing certifications in Oenology, Viticulture, and WSET, I have also earned the Rioja Wine Diploma, alongside other Spanish wine certifications. These didn’t just deepen my technical understanding, they pulled me further into my passion for Rioja and its wines. They made me want to learn more. To stand in those vineyards. To listen to the growers. To ask better questions. That pursuit has taken me through Portugal, Italy, France, Germany, the U.S., the Middle East, and, most often, Spain, where I’ve studied not just terroir but how regions hold history, how people protect it, and what it takes to carry that forward.
What I hope I offer isn’t just a résumé of countries or certifications, but rather a bridge. Between wine and education. Between tradition and innovation. Between a vineyard in La Rioja and a tasting table in Tokyo or Toronto. Over the past two decades, I’ve worked in more than 30 countries, building partnerships across regulated industries and cultural sectors. It’s taught me to listen first. To translate without flattening. And to celebrate specificity the kind Rioja has in spades.
What excites me most about Rioja Camp is exactly that: the chance to listen, learn, and lean in, through vineyard visits, bodega talks, and conversations that begin technical and end, as the best ones do, with tasting and understanding the wine.
As an entrepreneur and passionate creative, I’ve shaped much of my life around what stirs curiosity and calls for care. And if I could shape the next chapter, if I could place my bet, bottle by bottle, I would place it here, in Spain. In Rioja. There is no region I would be more proud to build with, learn from, and champion through my work.
Thank you for your consideration. I’d be honored to join Rioja Camp 2026, to deepen my roots in this region, and to help others discover just how alive Rioja really is.
Salud,
Mitchell Robertson
